# Results of annotation

This directory contains the results of the annotation used for the analysis presented in the paper. Two compressed directories, one for each genome assembly, are provided. The directories are organized as follows:
* 0_Transposable_elements_results: Final results of `TransposonUltimate`, including GFF and FASTA files, used for masking the genome.
* 1_Braker_results: GFF file containing the predicted genes generated by the `1_Braker.sh` script.
* 2_Trinotate_results: Reports generated by the Trinotate pipeline, including tabular and HTML reports.
* 3_Non-coding_RNA_results: Results of tRNAscan-SE and infernal.
